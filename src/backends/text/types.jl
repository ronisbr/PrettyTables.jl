# Pre-defined formats

The following pre-defined formats are available: `unicode` (**default**),
`mysql`, `compact`, `markdown`, `simple`, `ascii_rounded`, and `ascii_dots`.

    Highlighter

Defines the default highlighter of a table when using the text backend.

# Fields

* `f`: Function with the signature `f(data,i,j)` in which should return `true`
       if the element `(i,j)` in `data` must be highlighter, or `false`
       otherwise.
* `fd`: Function with the signature `f(h,data,i,j)` in which `h` is the
        highlighter. This function must return the `Crayon` to be applied to the
        cell that must be highlighted.
* `crayon`: The `Crayon` to be applied to the highlighted cell if the default
            `fd` is used.

# Remarks

This structure can be constructed using three helpers:

    Highlighter(f::Function; kwargs...)

where it will construct a `Crayon` using the keywords in `kwargs` and apply it
to the highlighted cell,

    Highlighter(f::Function, crayon::Crayon)

where it will apply the `crayon` to the highlighted cell, and

    Highlighter(f::Function, fd::Function)

where it will apply the `Crayon` returned by the function `fd` to the
highlighted cell.

"""
    Screen

Store the information of the screen and the current cursor position. Notice that
this is not the real cursor position with respect to the screen, but with
respect to the point in which the table is printed.

# Fields

* `size`: Screen size.
* `row`: Current row.
* `col`: Current column.
* `has_color`: Indicates if the screen has color support.
* `max_col`: Store the largest column that was printed.
