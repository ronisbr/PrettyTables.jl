    struct Highlighter

Defines the highlighter of a table when using the text backend.

# Fileds

* `f`: Function with the signature `f(data,i,j)` in which should return `true`

       otherwise.
* `crayon`: Crayon with the style of a highlighted element.

arguments `kwargs` to `Crayon`.

"""
    mutable struct Screen

Store the information of the screen and the current cursor position. Notice that
this is not the real cursor position with respect to the screen, but with
respect to the point in which the table is printed.

# Fields

* `size`: Screen size.
* `row`: Current row.
* `col`: Current column.
* `has_color`: Indicates if the screen has color support.
