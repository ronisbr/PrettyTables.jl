LaTeX back-end
==============

```@meta
CurrentModule = PrettyTables
DocTestSetup = quote
    using PrettyTables
end
```

The following options are available when the LaTeX backend is used. Those can be
passed as keywords when calling the function [`pretty_table`](@ref):

* `body_hlines`: A vector of `Int` indicating row numbers in which an additional
                 horizontal line should be drawn after the row. Notice that
                 numbers lower than 1 and equal or higher than the number of
                 printed rows will be neglected. This vector will be appended to
                 the one in `hlines`, but the indices here are related to the
                 printed rows of the body. Thus, if `1` is added to
                 `body_hlines`, then a horizontal line will be drawn after the
                 first data row. (**Default** = `Int[]`)
* `highlighters`: An instance of `LatexHighlighter` or a tuple with a list of
                  LaTeX highlighters (see the section
                  [LaTeX highlighters](@ref)).
* `hlines`: This variable controls where the horizontal lines will be drawn. It
            can be `nothing`, `:all`, `:none` or a vector of integers.
    - If it is `nothing`, which is the default, then the configuration will be
      obtained from the table format in the variable `tf` (see
      [`LatexTableFormat`](@ref)).
    - If it is `:all`, then all horizontal lines will be drawn.
    - If it is `:none`, then no horizontal line will be drawn.
    - If it is a vector of integers, then the horizontal lines will be drawn
      only after the rows in the vector. Notice that the top line will be drawn
      if `0` is in `hlines`, and the header and subheaders are considered as
      only 1 row. Furthermore, it is important to mention that the row number in
      this variable is related to the **printed rows**. Thus, it is affected by
      filters, and by the option to suppress the header `noheader`. Finally, for
      convenience, the top and bottom lines can be drawn by adding the symbols
      `:begin` and `:end` to this vector, respectively, and the line after the
      header can be drawn by adding the symbol `:header`.
  !!! info

      The values of `body_hlines` will be appended to this vector. Thus,
      horizontal lines can be drawn even if `hlines` is `:none`.

  (**Default** = `nothing`)
* `longtable_footer`: The string that will be drawn in the footer of the tables
                      before a page break. This only works if `table_type` is
                      `:longtable`. If it is `nothing`, then no footer will be
                      used. (**Default** = `nothing`)
* `noheader`: If `true`, then the header will not be printed. Notice that all
              keywords and parameters related to the header and sub-headers will
              be ignored. (**Default** = `false`)
* `nosubheader`: If `true`, then the sub-header will not be printed, *i.e.* the
                 header will contain only one line. Notice that this option has
                 no effect if `noheader = true`. (**Default** = `false`)
* `row_number_alignment`: Select the alignment of the row number column (see the
                          section [Alignment](@ref)). (**Default** = `:r`)
* `show_row_number`: If `true`, then a new column will be printed showing the
                     row number. (**Default** = `false`)
* `table_type`: Select which LaTeX environment will be used to print the table.
                Currently supported options are `:tabular` for `tabular` or
                `:longtable` for `longtable`. (**Default** = `:tabular`)
* `tf`: An instance of the structure [`LatexTableFormat`](@ref) that defines the
        general format of the LaTeX table.
* `vlines`: This variable controls where the vertical lines will be drawn. It
            can be `:all`, `:none` or a vector of integers. In the first case
            (the default behavior), all vertical lines will be drawn. In the
            second case, no vertical line will be drawn. In the third case,
            the vertical lines will be drawn only after the columns in the
            vector. Notice that the left border will be drawn if `0` is in
            `vlines`. Furthermore, it is important to mention that the column
            number in this variable is related to the **printed columns**. Thus,
            it is affected by filters, and by the columns added using the
            variable `show_row_number`. Finally, for convenience, the left and
            right border can be drawn by adding the symbols `:begin` and `:end`
            to this vector, respectively. (**Default** = `:none`)

## LaTeX highlighters

A set of highlighters can be passed as a `Tuple` to the `highlighters` keyword.
Each highlighter is an instance of the structure [`LatexHighlighter`](@ref). It
contains the following two fields:

* `f`: Function with the signature `f(data,i,j)` in which should return `true`
       if the element `(i,j)` in `data` must be highlighted, or `false`
       otherwise.
* `fd`: A function with the signature `f(data,i,j,str)::String` in which
        `data` is the matrix, `(i,j)` is the element position in the table, and
        `str` is the data converted to string. This function must return a
        string that will be placed in the cell.

The function `f` has the following signature:

    f(data, i, j)

in which `data` is a reference to the data that is being printed, `i` and `j`
are the element coordinates that are being tested. If this function returns
`true`, then the highlight style will be applied to the `(i,j)` element.
Otherwise, the default style will be used.

Notice that if multiple highlighters are valid for the element `(i,j)`, then the
applied style will be equal to the first match considering the order in the
Tuple `highlighters`.

If the function `f` returns true, then the function `fd(data,i,j,str)` will be
called and must return the LaTeX string that will be placed in the cell.

If only a single highlighter is wanted, then it can be passed directly to the
keyword `highlighter` without being inside a `Tuple`.

There are two helpers that can be used to create LaTeX highlighters:

```julia
LatexHighlighter(f::Function, envs::Union{String,Vector{String}})
LatexHighlighter(f::Function, fd::Function)
```

The first will apply recursively all the LaTeX environments in `envs` to the
highlighted text whereas the second let the user select the desired decoration
by specifying the function `fd`.

Thus, for example:

    LatexHighlighter((data,i,j)->true, ["textbf", "small"])

will wrap all the cells in the table in the following environment:

    \textbf{\small{<Cell text>}}

!!! info

    If only a single highlighter is wanted, then it can be passed directly to
    the keyword `highlighter` without being inside a `Tuple`.

!!! note

    If multiple highlighters are valid for the element `(i,j)`, then the applied
    style will be equal to the first match considering the order in the tuple
    `highlighters`.

!!! note

    If the highlighters are used together with [Formatters](@ref), then the
    change in the format **will not** affect the parameter `data` passed to the
    highlighter function `f`. It will always receive the original, unformatted
    value.

```julia-repl
julia> t = 0:1:20;

julia> data = hcat(t, ones(length(t))*1, 1*t, 0.5.*t.^2);

julia> header = ["Time" "Acceleration" "Velocity" "Distance";
                  "[s]"  "[m/s\$^2\$]"    "[m/s]"      "[m]"];

julia> hl_v = LatexHighlighter( (data,i,j)->(j == 3) && data[i,3] > 9, ["color{blue}","textbf"]);

julia> hl_p = LatexHighlighter( (data,i,j)->(j == 4) && data[i,4] > 10, ["color{red}", "textbf"])

julia> hl_e = LatexHighlighter( (data,i,j)->(i == 10), ["cellcolor{black}", "color{white}", "textbf"])

julia> pretty_table(data, header, backend = :latex, highlighters = (hl_e, hl_p, hl_v))
```

    The following LaTeX packages are required to render this example:
    `colortbl` and `xcolor`.
